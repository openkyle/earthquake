Have you ever wanted your players to shake and tremble as the ground rocks and shifts below them? 
Is a castle crumbling and they need to escape before its too late?
Is the very mountain itself exploding with magma as an active volcano erupts?

Well, before now - your players might have no idea... but now - the whole map is SHAKING!!!

Earthquake lets a GM trigger a configurable earthquake effect across every connected player client, with optional GM shaking.

The module includes bundled sounds, a draggable compendium macro, and an optional chat prompt for Dexterity checks. Tokens that fail the configured DC can be knocked Prone automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation

1) Install Earthquake from the Module Installation page of Foundry VTT

https://github.com/edgedoggo/earthquake/releases/download/latest/module.json

2) Enable it in your world.
3) Open the **Earthquake Macros** compendium pack.
4) Drag the **Earthquake** macro to your hotbar.
5) Click the macro to shake all connected clients and play the configured sound.

## Settings

- **Shake Intensity**: How strong the canvas shake feels.
- **Shake Duration**: How long the shake lasts.
- **Earthquake Sound**: The audio file played for every connected client.
- **Earthquake Sound Volume**: Per-client playback volume.
- **Shake GM Canvas**: Allows the GM to opt out of the visual shake.
- **Prompt Dexterity Checks**: Posts a chat prompt for every actor token on the active canvas.
- **Dexterity Check DC**: The DC used by the chat prompt.
- **Knock Prone On Failed Check**: Applies the Prone status when a token fails.

## Macro API

The included macro runs:

```js
await game.earthquake.trigger();
```

Advanced macros can override settings for a single earthquake:

```js
await game.earthquake.trigger({
  intensity: 120,
  duration: 8000,
  soundPath: "modules/earthquake/assets/sounds/collapse.ogg",
  promptDexterity: true,
  dexterityDC: 16,
  applyProne: true
});
```
